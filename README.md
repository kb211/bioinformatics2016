featurize_fuction is a function I made that needs to be plugged into the model_comparison.py file in the Azimuth repo. It intercepts the inputs and creates a dataframe out of them. It also appends the ground truths to each data point.

featurized_data.csv are all the different features after they have been transformed with their ground truths. A more detailed description will come soon.
